### ðŸ‘¤ whoami
Cybersecurity enthusiast, PT/Red Teamer. Im currently work on offensive security with technical and practical approach.

### ðŸ’¼ what im doing
In my spare time I try to develop custom tools for Red Team, post-exploitation and automation. I also trying to do exploit development, reverse engineering and threat simulation.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
- Low-level C++ to develop loaders, shellcode wrappers, reflective DLLs, etc.
- Windows internals (API, PE, memory management, syscall)
- Advanced techniques to bypass EDR/sandbox and persistence.
- Architecture and design of modular and OPSEC-safe C2 frameworks.

### general
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on red teaming frameworks, adversary simulation, and custom implants and phishing simulations.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced anti-forensics and hypervisor-level evasion techniques.
